              <h2>The Reason for Corvus</h2>
              <p>
                While in the technology epicenter regions in the globe, new services have reached the point of competing in producing higher and higher percentages of efficiency over maximum percentages.

It is obvious that even basic computational issues such as data control, payroll or cash flow have not yet been implemented, although they are necessary to improve the production of both companies and society in general.
